# Selemium-Chromed-driver
Using Chrome Driver and the Java Selenium client to automate
In this project you will learn how to use Java Selenium Client and Chrome Driver for automation i.e. you will learn to write a script in java that will open a chrome browser, search the desired webpage, put values in textbox, click a button and retrieve the data. This is one of the very basic use of selenium. 
You can download the latest version of Selenium on http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/ On the same web page you can also download the latest version of google chrome driver under the section 'Third Party Drivers, Bindings, and Plugins'.
I have used Eclipse to write my scripts. You can download it from https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
TestNG is a testing framework for Java is also being used in the code. You can download it directly in Eclipse. Go to help, Eclipse Marketplace and search for TestNG for Eclipse. Once you install it you have restart your Eclipse.
Now once you have installed all the required software you are ready to start scripting.
Open Eclipse and create a new project. Under src create a new package. Create a new class. 
Create two new folders under your project and name it ExeFiles and JarFiles. Copy the chromedriver.exe file and paste it under ExeFiles and copy selenium-server-standalone-3.11.0 and paste it under JarFiles. Right click on this file and build path.
To find the xpath of an element on the webpage right click on that element and go to Inspect. Copy the xpath.
Now you can use the script and keep trying and experimenting new things!
